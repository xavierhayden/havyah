###Daily Log
Day 2: We started by setting up basics on our raspberry pi. By using the code "sudo raspi-config" into the console, we changed internal components like allowing ssh and setting up the correct clock, as well as setting up a new password. By applying for a Clearpass, we were able to get the pi to have its own ip address.I also had to download a program called Putty, which allowed a windows user ssh access from Putty's terminal. 

We set up the ssh remote access to use on our own laptops in order to allow "headless" access once knowing the correct ip address
